            <h3>Organization Description</h3>
            <p>
                Mannabase is an online platform for the world's first Universal Basic Income cryptocurrency.
                Manna is distributed by the nonprofit Hedge 4 Humanity as a basic human right that every person in the world is eligible to receive, for free.
                Founded in 2015, Manna has achieved milestones in the cryptocurrency movement, as the first blockchain-based currency to be created and distributed by a tax-exempt nonprofit organization, and the first digital currency to implement a Universal Basic Income as its primary method of distribution.
                It currently distributes Manna weekly to about 100,000 users. The website is written in Vue.js with a Node.js server backend.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3><b>The 2018-19 Year</b></h3>
            <p>
                To warm up to the codebase, we added two-factor authentication to <a href="https://www.mannabase.com/">mannabase.com</a> as an added optional securiy measure.
                We also added a settings page to allow the user to change their email, name, and password.
            </p>
            <p>
                We aim for users to build a targeted direct giving portfolio so that users who want to participate in the UBI
                but want to provide to others can allocate their weekly Manna to other causes and users of their choice.
                We began by fleshing out a new dashboard page, profile pages for users, the ability to search for users, to add them as "connections",
                and a new "Wallet" page that displays the user's transaction history in a more readable way. This work is currently under review.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3><b>The 2019-20 Year</b></h3>
            This year, Mannabase has become one branch of several in the parent nonprofit, Hedge 4 Humanity. We will be tackling several
            initiatives:
            <br />
            <br />
            <h4>BrightID</h4>
            <p>
                A global UBI can attract many spam accounts. This makes verifying the uniqueness of individual accounts
                of utmost importance. Currently, users upon signup will be asked to send photos of their face and government id,
                which is manually reviewed by Mannabase staff. This process does not scale well.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the heart of this problem lies the challenge of validating unique identity.
                How can one distinguish real accounts from fake ones? One approach is analyze connections between accounts
                in a graph setting, much like how PageRank is used to validate the relevance/trustworthiness of web pages.
                <a href="https://brightid.org">BrightID</a> aims to do this with a mobile app for people to form connections with people they trust.
                This app will contact a peer-to-peer network that will return scores that represent an individual account's trustworthiness.
                These scores can then port to arbitrary applications.
            </p>
            Members of the Hedge 4 Humanity Team will be able to tackle a variety of different areas for BrightID, including:
            <ul>
                <li>The ability for a user to recover their connections if they lose their device.</li>
                <li>The ability to flag users for removal from a group.</li>
                <li>Peer-to-peer consensus functionaltiy between server nodes for the connection DB.</li>
                <li>Anti-sybil algorithms and upgrading BrightID's security.</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <h4>Dollar For Everyone</h4>
            <p>
                Mannabase's Manna currency is quite speculative. Although its value may increase someday,
                 we hope to also use a cryptocurrency at the moment with a more stable currency. That currency
                 is DAI, which is a stable coin. It also has great infrastructure for <a href="https://xdai.io/">burner wallets</a>
                 that will allow users who are new to the cryptocurrency world easily participate and receive currency.
                 The Dollar4Everyone project will be another UBI with this stablecoin, which can use BrightID to verify uniqueness
                 of users. Members have the opporunity to also be intimately involved in building this project from scratch.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4>Hedge 4 Humanity Website</h4>
            <p>
                Hedge 4 Humanity will be making a new website explaining the organization's structure and allowing for easy donation.
                It will likely be partially implemented in Wordpress. There is already a developer working on this project, but members
                can also help with this development as well.
