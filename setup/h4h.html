            <h3>Organization Description</h3>
            <p>
                Mannabase is an online platform for the world's first Universal Basic Income cryptocurrency.
                Manna is distributed by the nonprofit Hedge 4 Humanity as a basic human right that every person in the world is eligible to receive, for free.
                Founded in 2015, Manna has achieved milestones in the cryptocurrency movement, as the first blockchain-based currency to be created and distributed by a tax-exempt nonprofit organization, and the first digital currency to implement a Universal Basic Income as its primary method of distribution.
                It currently distributes Manna weekly to about 100,000 users. The website is written in Vue.js with a Node.js server backend.

            <h3>The 2018-19 Year</h3>
            <p>
                To warm up to the codebase, we added two-factor authentication to <a href="https://www.mannabase.com/">mannabase.com</a> as an added optional securiy measure.
                We also added a settings page to allow the user to change their email, name, and password.
            </p>
            <p>
                We aim for users to build a targeted direct giving portfolio so that users who want to participate in the UBI
                but want to provide to others can allocate their weekly Manna to other causes and users of their choice.
                We began by fleshing out a new dashboard page, profile pages for users, the ability to search for users, to add them as "connections",
                and a new "Wallet" page that displays the user's transaction history in a more readable way.
            </p>
