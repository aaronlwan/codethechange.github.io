                In January 2019, our development team worked on an existing codebase that only had three simple HTML pages
                that were loosely integrated with Mongoose.js and MongoDB for the matching application. However, our needs 
                for the application warranted a complete overhaul of the codebase, which led us to implement the MERN Stack
                soon after. With our application running on MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, we were able to create
                a streamlined, user-friendly web service capable of matching mentors to mentees based on their common 
                characteristics. In the process, each of our team members developed first-hand experience with design, 
                front-end, and back-end development.

                Initially, our focus was on designing the UI by creating wireframes for each page layout. Once we were comfortable with the direction of the user experience, our next duty was to translate that easy-to-digest UI into front-end code using React, Redux Forms, and Bootstrap. This process took several months given that much of our target demographic, migrants and refugees, have limited experience with computers. While working on the front-end, our team was also building a robust matching algorithm in JavaScript that is not only capable of providing great matches, but also good at handling edge cases (i.e. if no matches are found). Once a match was made, the largest task on the front-end was ensuring that this information was displayed concisely to the mentor and mentee. Meanwhile, some of our team started focusing more on the back-end/server-side aspect of the application, which mainly consisted of handling HTTP requests that could match users together and display the resulting information to the client. Although none of us had any form of training in backend development, we were able to learn using web resources and tinkering how to make our application to work properly. Although this was a time consuming and stressful process, it ultimately taught us a lot and led us to create a usable and secure web app

                Within seven months of starting the project, we had a working beta build that was ready for production. 
                After thoroughly testing the build from the front-end to back-end, we are ready to deploy the application to Heroku,
                which is when the Konexio team in Paris will utilize our web app in order to amplify the social impact they are creating
                for underserved communities in France.
