        During the 2019-2020 school year, we built a filtering system for Tarjimly so that users within the app can
        search for translators with specific criteria such as professional expertise, phone interpretation, document
        translation, and demographic preferences. These filters enable refugees and aid workers to bypass the vocational
        and cultural barriers that arise with traditional language translation.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the front-end work, we used React Native and Redux in order to populate the UI and maintain the application’s
        state when users select certain filters. When a user selects the “Filters” button before searching for translators,
        they are introduced to a pop-up modal that shows them a list of two types of filters: “hard” filters and “soft”
        filters. Hard filters (e.g. medical or legal translating) are mandatory constraints that are guaranteed to be met
        when connecting with a translator, while soft filters (e.g. urgent translator, translator from my organization)
        are satisfied given certain constraints such as the number of translators available, the number of other soft
        filters satisfied, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once we enabled the ability to select filters on the front-end, the next step was to create a REST API endpoint
        that parses and sends these filters (in addition to other data) to the server for processing. From here, the final
        step to select a sufficient number of filtered translators was to build a Python + Django microservice to fetch
        translators from the database, algorithmically filter out the ineligible translators based on various parameters,
        and then return the remaining translators back to the server. At this point, the final step entailed sending a
        response back to the front-end, where the user could finally be matched with a translator based on the filters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, this was an excellent opportunity for us to learn about full-stack engineering, product planning (both
        design-wise and algorithmically), and teamwork. Our Tarjimly project provided the right balance between having a
        robust support structure and allowing for creative freedom. If this kind of project seems interesting to you, there
        are several ongoing projects that we think you’d like!
