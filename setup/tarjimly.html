        We are currently building a filtering system for Tarjimly so that users within the app
        can search for translators with specific criteria such as medical/legal expertise and religious
        preferences. Implementing this filtering system enables refugees and aid workers to bypass the
        vocational and cultural barriers that arise with traditional language translation.

        Once the filtering system is in place, we are planning to improve the current algorithm in order
        to improve wait times and provide a more accurate match between users and translators. With a
        combination of data visualization and machine learning, we hope to make the matching process as
        robust and efficient as possible.
