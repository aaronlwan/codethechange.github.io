        For the upcoming school year, our focus will be on getting HospitalRun’s desktop and web React apps to version 2.0
        (release build), which will be a significant improvement for current users compared to the beta build.
      </p>

        Some of the features we worked on last year include viewable diagnoses, inventory modules, and incident notes! For 
        additional information about HospitalRun’s mission and implementation, visit
