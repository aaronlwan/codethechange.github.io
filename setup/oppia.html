                Oppia is an online education platform that serves almost 430,000 students worldwide. Unlike other education platforms, Oppia is heavily volunteer-based, from the people who create the lessons to the developers who build new features. Because of this, it is structured as a strong network of opensource developers, artists, teachers, and students. From day 1, as a part of the Oppia team, you will be welcomed by an onboarding team at Oppia, which will help you through an initial starter project.

                In previous years, students who worked with Oppia have developed new features like a Takeout feature which allows users to manage and delete their own data and a Docker container to allow Oppia's Windows developers to have the same convenience as Linux/Mac developers. As an opensource developer for Oppia, you will be interacting with developers who have the same motivations as you all across the world, from India to Malaysia to the US.

                Based on AngularJS and Python, Oppia is constantly improving its platform through direct feedback from the students, teachers, and volunteers. Examples of future projects that you can work on include creating features to advance the lesson creating process, developing Oppia's Android application, and improving the lesson feedback pipeline from the user to the teacher.
