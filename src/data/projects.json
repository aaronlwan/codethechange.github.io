        "narrative":"<p>This collaboration started when <a href=\"https://law.stanford.edu/directory/luciana-herman/\">Luci Herman</a>, Program Director for the Law and Policy Lab at the Stanford Law School, reached out to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-suciu-57989571/\">Andrew Suciu</a>, then president of Stanford Code the Change, to find a team of computer science students to design a prototype website as part of a Law School practicum course. Law students in the course, taught by Professor <a href=\"https://law.stanford.edu/directory/paul-goldstein/\">Paul Goldstein</a> and renowned expert on international copyright law, wanted to reduce rampant theft of copyrighted photos online (e.g. from Google Images) and introduce a new platform to enable frictionless licenses between users and owners of copyrighted photos and images. Code the Change was challenged with prototyping such a platform that would specifically address the needs of so-called “long-tail” users, such as independent or community organizations that publish a low volume of photos online.</p><p>Over the course of two quarters, a team of five Code the Change students led by Christopher Yeh developed a prototype website to demonstrate the photo licensing concepts developed in the Stanford Law School practicum. The website included a user system to record transaction history, integration with Stripe’s API for processing payments for photo licenses, and a search system for finding uploaded photos. The features can be seen in the screenshots below and explored live at <a href=\"https://copyright-license.herokuapp.com/\">https://copyright-license.herokuapp.com/</a></p><p>Because the website was only intended as a prototype and not a production server, the team decided to use free tools. The team chose to host the website on Heroku with uploaded images stored in an Amazon AWS S3 bucket. Data about the images and photo licenses were stored in a PostgreSQL database, also hosted by Heroku. The web server written in Python using the Flask library, including the Flask-Login extension for managing user logins. Finally, we used the Masonry.js javascript grid layout library in the front-end to display images in a responsive, tiled format. While some members of the team had some experience building websites (e.g. at the level of CS 142), almost everyone was learning how to use these technologies on-the-spot.</p><p>At the end of the two quarters, the team was proud to present its work to the Stanford Law School practicum course (LAW 414O), and the website was submitted to the U.S. Copyright Office in a report titled titled <a href=\"https://law.stanford.edu/publications/a-low-cost-digital-licensing-platform-for-photographs-documentation-for-a-prototype/\">“A Low-Cost Digital Licensing Platform for Photographs: Documentation for a Prototype”</a>. The team is especially grateful for Luci Herman and Professor Paul Goldstein from the Stanford Law School for this incredible learning opportunity to build and design a website for a good cause.</p>",

Each member worked on frontend, backend, and/or design based on their interests and skills.</p><p>We first started out with learning the fundamental technologies, including but not limited to React, Redux and Salesforce, which are the building blocks of the web application we are maintaining for Project Homeless Connect. Prior to each Project Homeless Connect’s one-stop shop event, we would adapt the schema of the data storage regarding the services the organization provides. During this time, we have to change the frontend code to include additional services or remove unnecessary ones, and also update the corresponding data fields in Salesforce. After the necessary changes, we first test our changes on a sandbox/development version before moving over our code changes to production. We were fortunate enough to be invited over to the 69th iteration of Project Homeless Connect one-stop shop event and were blessed to see our app being used in the hands of the volunteers checking in and checking out 1000+ homeless accessing services from haircuts to medical vaccinations.</p><p>Realizing that the task to provide the necessary changes to the data schema is extremely manual and requires a bit of technical expertise, we then moved over to building an admin platform to do the necessary changes before each of their one-stop shop event without needing any coding experience.</p>",

CultureMesh LLC builds networks to match these real-world dynamics and knit the diverse fabrics of our world together. CultureMesh is a public benefit corporation that has its own website and Android app. There have been about 1000 users over CultureMesh’s lifetime, and we hope to grow this user base in a more iterative, data-driven way. To learn more about CultureMesh, be sure to check out its <a href=\"https://www.culturemesh.com\">website</a>.<p>Under the current design, CutlureMesh users join forums called \"Networks\" that consist of people who currently live in a given location (i.e. Palo Alto) and are from another location (i.e. France). Networks can also consist of people living in a location who speak a certain language (i.e. French). In these networks, people can create posts or events.</p></p><h3>Our Role</h3><p>Since CultureMesh is very small, CultureMesh currently depends on our Stanford Code the Change chapter to maintain the codebase. CultureMesh has an existing website, as well as Facebook Free Basics and Android apps (that Code the Change created last year), so this year’s focus will be on refining all three to better serve user needs. We will be iterating on the existing products based on user feedback as the platform expands. The website is currently written with a PHP frontend and backend, and the Android app is written in Java with a Flask backend. The Facebook Free Basics app is written in Flask. We are currently considering development on all these fronts.</p><h3>Past Work</h3><h4>Android Application</h4><p>The Android application was natively developed in Android Studio. It current supports exploring popular locations for networks, creating posts, commenting on posts, creating events, and joining/leaving events. You can check out the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.culturemesh.android\">Google Play Store Listing</a> and our <a href=\"https://github.com/culturemesh/CultureMeshAndroid\">codebase</a>.</p><h4>FFB</h4><p>The Facebook Free Basics Application allows users with low-resourced mobile phones to still interact with CultureMesh. Like the Google AMP project, the application cannot use any Javascript. You can check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/alanefl/culturemeshFFB\"> codebase.</a></p><h4>Back-End API</h4>The API was written in Flask and is hosted on the same Bluehost server as the website. You can check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/alanefl/culturemesh-api\"> codebase</a>.",
