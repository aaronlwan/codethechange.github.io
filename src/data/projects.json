Law students in the course, taught by Professor <a href=\"https://law.stanford.edu/directory/paul-goldstein/\">Paul Goldstein</a> and renowned expert on international copyright law, wanted to reduce rampant theft of copyrighted photos online (e.g. from Google Images) and introduce a new platform to enable frictionless licenses between users and owners of copyrighted photos and images. Code the Change was challenged with prototyping such a platform that would specifically address the needs of so-called \u201clong-tail\u201d users, such as independent or community organizations that publish a low volume of photos online.</p><p>Over the course of two quarters, a team of five Code the Change students led by Christopher Yeh developed a prototype website to demonstrate the photo licensing concepts developed in the Stanford Law School practicum. The website included a user system to record transaction history, integration with Stripe\u2019s API for processing payments for photo licenses, and a search system for finding uploaded photos. The features can be seen in the screenshots below and explored live at <a href=\"https://copyright-license.herokuapp.com/\">https://copyright-license.herokuapp.com/</a></p><p>Because the website was only intended as a prototype and not a production server, the team decided to use free tools. The team chose to host the website on Heroku with uploaded images stored in an Amazon AWS S3 bucket. Data about the images and photo licenses were stored in a PostgreSQL database, also hosted by Heroku. The web server written in Python using the Flask library, including the Flask-Login extension for managing user logins. Finally, we used the Masonry.js javascript grid layout library in the front-end to display images in a responsive, tiled format. While some members of the team had some experience building websites (e.g. at the level of CS 142), almost everyone was learning how to use these technologies on-the-spot.</p><p>At the end of the two quarters, the team was proud to present its work to the Stanford Law School practicum course (LAW 414O), and the website was submitted to the U.S. Copyright Office in a report titled titled <a href=\"https://law.stanford.edu/publications/a-low-cost-digital-licensing-platform-for-photographs-documentation-for-a-prototype/\">\u201cA Low-Cost Digital Licensing Platform for Photographs: Documentation for a Prototype\u201d</a>.

CultureMesh is a public benefit corporation that has its own website and Android app. There have been about 1000 users over CultureMesh\u2019s lifetime, and we hope to grow this user base in a more iterative, data-driven way. To learn more about CultureMesh, be sure to check out its <a href=\"https://www.culturemesh.com\">website</a>.<p>Under the current design, CutlureMesh users join forums called \"Networks\" that consist of people who currently live in a given location (i.e. Palo Alto) and are from another location (i.e. France). Networks can also consist of people living in a location who speak a certain language (i.e. French). In these networks, people can create posts or events.</p></p><h3>Our Role</h3><p>Since CultureMesh is very small, CultureMesh currently depends on our Stanford Code the Change chapter to maintain the codebase. CultureMesh has an existing website, as well as Facebook Free Basics and Android apps (that Code the Change created last year), so this year\u2019s focus will be on refining all three to better serve user needs. We will be iterating on the existing products based on user feedback as the platform expands. The website is currently written with a PHP frontend and backend, and the Android app is written in Java with a Flask backend. The Facebook Free Basics app is written in Flask. We are currently considering development on all these fronts.</p><h3>Past Work</h3><h4>Android Application</h4><p>The Android application was natively developed in Android Studio. It current supports exploring popular locations for networks, creating posts, commenting on posts, creating events, and joining/leaving events.

Like the Google AMP project, the application cannot use any Javascript. You can check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/alanefl/culturemeshFFB\"> codebase.</a></p><h4>Back-End API</h4>The API was written in Flask and is hosted on the same Bluehost server as the website.

However, our needs                     for the application warranted a complete overhaul of the codebase, which led us to implement the MERN Stack                    soon after. With our application running on MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, we were able to create                    a streamlined, user-friendly web service capable of matching mentors to mentees based on their common                     characteristics. In the process, each of our team members developed first-hand experience with design,                     front-end, and back-end development.            </p><p>                Initially, our focus was on designing the UI by creating wireframes for each page layout. Once we were comfortable with the direction of the user experience, our next duty was to translate that easy-to-digest UI into front-end code using React, Redux Forms, and Bootstrap. This process took several months given that much of our target demographic, migrants and refugees, have limited experience with computers. While working on the front-end, our team was also building a robust matching algorithm in JavaScript that is not only capable of providing great matches, but also good at handling edge cases (i.e. if no matches are found). Once a match was made, the largest task on the front-end was ensuring that this information was displayed concisely to the mentor and mentee. Meanwhile, some of our team started focusing more on the back-end/server-side aspect of the application, which mainly consisted of handling HTTP requests that could match users together and display the resulting information to the client. Although none of us had any form of training in backend development, we were able to learn using web resources and tinkering how to make our application to work properly. Although this was a time consuming and stressful process, it ultimately taught us a lot and led us to create a usable and secure web app            </p><p>                Within seven months of starting the project, we had a working beta build that was ready for production.                 After thoroughly testing the build from the front-end to back-end, we are ready to deploy the application to Heroku,                which is when the Konexio team in Paris will utilize our web app in order to amplify the social impact they are creating                for underserved communities in France.            </p>",

(Note that the data only count how many cell phones transitioned from one cell tower to another each day, so we cannot track individual phones.) Our tool uses maps and cell tower positions to estimate how many people move between any two political regions (e.g. provinces) each day.</p><p>To perform this estimation, we convert the provided migration data into a matrix. Then, we compute matrices that describe the fraction of each cell tower's range that is within each political region and that describe the fraction of each political region that is covered by each cell tower's range. Multiplying these three matrices yields the migration data between political regions. Efficiency was paramount since countries can have thousands of political regions. For example, the United States has over three thousand counties (Source: <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-many-counties-are-there-united-states\">USGS</a>). We relied on matrices in part because we optimized matrix operations using <a href=\"https://www.numpy.org/\">numpy</a>. We used an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-tree\">RTree</a>, a geospatial data structure, to efficiently calculate the overlaps between polygons. This efficiency came from the RTree telling us which polygons had overlapping bounding boxes, drastically reducing the number of polygons we needed to consider. Combined, these optimizations let us perform our computations in a reasonable amount of time.</p><p>To make it easy for UNICEF to pick up our work once we finished, we emphasized having comprehensive documentation and unit tests as much as correctness. We also isolated the code that performs generally useful operations (e.g. computing polygon overlap) from the code that loads the data from files. This makes it easy to change the format of the data files--you only have to modify the isolated function that handles that particular file.</p><p>If you want to check out our work, take a look at our GitHub repository <a href=\"https://github.com/codethechange/mobility_pipeline\">here</a>.
